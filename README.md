Typing test/Python web dev playground

I kinda wanted to make my own typing test and used it as an excute to try developing a website with python, jquery got somehow involved and here we are.

This will never be as complex as Monkeytype but still fun to work on.

live version is hosted on https://tiny.cc/drunktyper it's running on my hardware and tunneled with ngrok (might have downtime)
